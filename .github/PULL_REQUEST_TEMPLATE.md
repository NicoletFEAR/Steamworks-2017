## For Reviewers

Here are some things to look for:
 * Comments in the code.
   - Comments explain *why* the code is doing something, not what or how.
* No "magic numbers" or hard coded constants.
* Small code change (i.e. 10-15 lines or so)
* The code implements the design specified in the corresponding story.
* The code interfaces with other code and hardware properly.
  - Ex. Code implementing a command for one subsystem should not affect another subsystem.
  - Ex. Objects representing hardware on the robot should only be accessed in a subsystem.
  - Ex. Joysticks should only be accessed in setting up buttons or in commands (not subsystems).
